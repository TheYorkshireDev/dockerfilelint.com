## Contributing

As mentioned above we would welcome contributors for the website. There are many ways to contribute to the Code project: logging bugs, submitting pull requests, reporting issues, and creating suggestions. We would also welcome contributions on the testing front. When we inherited the project there was a lack of unit tests and automated testing which we would like assistance in putting right.

### Branching

I have decided to use the branching model proposed by [@nvie](https://github.com/nvie) in his [blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

#### Reviewing and Merging a Feature
*Step 1.* Fetch and check out the branch for this merge request
```
git fetch origin
git checkout -b feature-T2 origin/feature-T2
```
*Step 2.* Review the changes locally
*Step 3.* Merge the branch and fix any conflicts that come up
```
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature-T2
```
*Step 4.* Push the result of the merge to GitLab/GitHub
```
git push origin develop
```

#### Reviewing and Merging a Release
*Step 1.* Fetch and check out the branch for this merge request
```
git fetch origin
git checkout -b release/0.0.1 origin/release/0.0.1
```
*Step 2.* Review the changes locally
*Step 3.* Merge the branch to master
```
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release/0.0.1
git tag -a 0.0.1
```
*Step 4.* Push the result of the merge to GitLab/GitHub
```
git push --follow-tags origin master
```
*Step 5.* Merge the branch into develop and fix any conflicts that come up
```
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/0.0.1
```
*Step 6.* Push the result of the merge to GitLab/GitHub
```
git push origin develop
```

### Consistent Code Style
This project includes a `.editorconfig` file which I ask you to adhere too. The easiest way is just to use a modern editor, most of which have not added support for editor config and will change the code style settings by default upon detecting the `.editorconfig` file in the root of the repository. You may want to check your editors compatibility or just read up on the project at the EditorConfig [website](http://editorconfig.org).
